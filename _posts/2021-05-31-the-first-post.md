## Hello My First Post.

> Hello, my blog

This my first website ever had and I believe that this would change my lifestyle. 
There are two points I started this blog.
First, I wanted to show and prove what I have done.
Second, I wanted to record what I learn in everyday life. It doesn't have to be related to my work. 

I used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Leonids](https://github.com/renyuanz/leonids/tree/leonids-jekyll) theme to start my first blog ever. 
I am shocked that Jekyll and the theme make the static website simple and handy. I think the best part of it is using a Markdown file to make a post.
Eventually, I want to make my website using my current knowledge and the tech stack I use, but this Github pages blog will be my first step.

Let the blog begin.
